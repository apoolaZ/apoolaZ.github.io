As the board recieves input from Keith's subsystem, the IR Emitter calculates the light value from the sensor which then turns into a High/Low value. This is then output that is transfers to Tim's subsystem which uses it as a way to have the motor function until the motor reaches below the light threshold of 500. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>To review the details and relationships between the system\u2019s components, refer to the Block Diagram section of the datasheet.</li> <li>To review the system\u2019s components, refer to the Component Selection.</li> <li>To review power distribution, refer to the Power Budget.</li> <li>To review the layout of the individual subsystem, refer to the Schematic.</li> <li>To review the cost of components in the subsystem, refer to the Bill of Materials.</li> <li>To review the PCB Design of the project, refer to the PCB Design.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The purpose of this block diagram is to showcase the IR Emitter Detector Pair Sensor that would act as a motion sensor to stop the motor when there is an object in the way based on the light value detected from the sensor.

As the board is powered, there are a total of 3 inputs and 2 outputs to show where the connections are made and who is recieving/outputing data. To ensure that data was being transfered, the ribbon cables inputs had to match the other's output which is shown with the first ribbon cable as the input is the first connector which matches Keith's connection pinout. The same goes for the second ribbon connector as this subsystem gives the output values through the second connection which on Tim's board, should be connection two for the input on his ribbon cable. There is a debugger LED and button for troubleshooting and/or to show the results through the two components. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Draw.io Link</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Example","text":"<p>Motion Sensors</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sensor PIR(Passive Infrared) Low Power</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$5.03/each</li> <li>PYD1598</li> </ul> Pros Cons Has four pins Expensive Has a touchless switch Low-power consumption of only 3mA at 1.8V Has a digital interface for detector configuration Only can detect through pyroceramic </li> <li> <p>Sensor PIR (Passive Infrared) Radial, Metal Can, Lensed - 3 Lead</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.17/each</li> <li>IRAS210ST01</li> </ul> Pros Cons Uses pyroelectric effect of pyroelectric ceramics Would need to test for three items (Responsivity, white noise, and source voltage) Can handle 2.0 to 15.0 V of VDC power Need to be careful of placement Has a detailed datasheet </li> <li> <p>IR Emitter</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$4.16/each</li> <li>OPB732</li> </ul> Pros Cons Has both Infrared LED and Photoresistor Expensive Something familiar Layout of pins is confusing Uses Light value </li> </ol> <p>Choice  Option 3 - IR Emitter</p> <p>Rationale  Though many motion sensors use PIR Sensors to sense objects through heat, the IR Emitter uses light sensors and is something that was taught within the course.
