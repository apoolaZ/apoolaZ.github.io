With the motion sensor, it would recieve the output from the thermoresistor sensor from the first pinout in the first connector. The motion sensor contains the information of the average temperature which allows the motion sensor to determine if the actuator moves. If the value is 1, the actuator moves with the motion sensor determining if it continues until an object/person/pet is in the way, which in turn stops.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Draw.io Link</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Example","text":"<p>Motion Sensors</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sensor PIR(Passive Infrared) Low Power</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$5.03/each</li> <li>PYD1598</li> </ul> Pros Cons Has four pins Expensive Has a touchless switch Low-power consumption of only 3mA at 1.8V Has a digital interface for detector configuration Only can detect through pyroceramic </li> <li> <p>Sensor PIR (Passive Infrared) Radial, Metal Can, Lensed - 3 Lead</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.17/each</li> <li>IRAS210ST01</li> </ul> Pros Cons Uses pyroelectric effect of pyroelectric ceramics Would need to test for three items (Responsivity, white noise, and source voltage) Can handle 2.0 to 15.0 V of VDC power Need to be careful of placement Has a detailed datasheet 1.
