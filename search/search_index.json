With option 1, the part is inexpensive compared to several other h-bridges and it is something that is familiar within the course. Furthermore, it can handle the thermal heat which is important as heat can be created by rapid movement which posses a safety issue with user if it reaches to a certain temperature.</p> <p>DC Motors</p> <ol> <li> <p>Brushed DC Motor Standard 12850 RPM 12VDC</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$5.22/each</li> <li>PAN14EE12AA1</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive Requires external components and support circuitry for interface Is within the voltage output for the PIC Smaller than what is needed </li> <li> <p>Standard Motor 10000 RPM 6V</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$78/each</li> <li>22N28-216E.286</li> </ul> Pros Cons Has high RPM Too expensive for this project Sizing is ideal for the electric blinds </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 1: Brushed DC Motor Standard 12850 RPM 12VDC</p> <p>Rationale: A DC motor is the main component for the Team 105's acuator. As such, motors tend to be very expensive if not carefully selected as shown in option 2. With option 1, it would be compatible with our main project as it's voltage output is within the bounds of the PIC Microcontroller. Despite option 1 being choosen, there will need further research for other possible motors that would be big enough as this DC motor is too tiny for the project.  </p> <p>MOSEFETS</p> <ol> <li> <p>MOSFET N-CH 60V 7A/22A TO220-3F</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.66/each</li> <li>AOTF2618Lt</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive and compatible with motor Prone to overheating fast Conduction and switching PWR losses are minimized Vulnerable to ESD and overvoltage </li> <li> <p>MOSFET N/P-CH 30V 3.8A TSOT26</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.42/each</li> <li>DMG6601LVT-7</li> </ul> Pros Cons Fast switching speed Would need to look into the voltage Inexpensive Would need to solder </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 1: MOSFET N-CH 60V 7A/22A TO220-3F</p> <p>Rationale: Despite option 2 would be ideal as it's inexpensive, option 1 is the ultimate choice as it is known to funtion with the PIC microcontroller without possible damage. Furthermore, option 2 would involve soldering and a seperate PCB to function which is beyound what is taught in the 304 course. </p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
