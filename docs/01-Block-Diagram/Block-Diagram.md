## Overview

The purpose of this block diagram is to showcase the IR Emitter Detector Pair Sensor that would act as a motion sensor to stop the motor when there is an object in the way based on the light value detected from the sensor. There are two connectors as a way to transfer data from thermoresistor to the motor while giving output to motor on when to stop.

## Conclusions

From the block diagram from above, the board is powered by the voltage regulator which is one of the criterias for the course. As the board is powered, there are a total of 3 inputs and 2 outputs to show where the connections are made and who is recieving/outputing data. To ensure that data was being transfered, the ribbon cables inputs had to match the other's output which is shown with the first ribbon cable as the input is the first connector which matches Keith's connection pinout. The same goes for the second ribbon connector as this subsystem gives the output values through the second connection which on Tim's board, should be connection two for the input on his ribbon cable. There is a debugger LED and button for troubleshooting and/or to show the results through the two components.
