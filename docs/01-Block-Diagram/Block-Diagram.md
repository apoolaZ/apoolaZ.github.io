## Overview

The purpose of this block diagram is to showcase the IR Emitter Detector Pair Sensor that would act as a motion sensor to stop the motor when there is an object in the way based on the light value detected from the sensor. There are two connectors as a way to transfer data from thermoresistor to the motor while giving output to motor on when to stop.
