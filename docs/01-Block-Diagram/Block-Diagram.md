## Overview
The purpose of this block diagram is to showcase the motor system (acuator) of the main project of Team 105. The motors serve as a way for the blinds to be in motion with the other three functionalities (Motion Sensor, Light Sensor, and Thermometers) hooked to the main connector with one another.
