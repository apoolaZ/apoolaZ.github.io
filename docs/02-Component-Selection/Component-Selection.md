    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Inexpensive                               | Would need to code in depth with other portions                  |
    | Has high Thermal capailities              | Needs special PCB layout.                                        |
    | Has four function channels (Forward/Reverse/Stop/Brake) |                                                    |

    * $1.29/each
    * [TB67H451FNG](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/toshiba-semiconductor-and-storage/TB67H451FNG-EL/11568781)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Has a realization of high voltage and large current drive         | Only 13 cents more expensive    |
    | Has built-in various error detections                             | On the documentation, it is not recommended for new design |
    |                                                                   | Need to be careful with thermal condition |

**Choice:** Brush DC Motor Controller (FAN8100N)

**Rationale:** An H-bridge is one of the few ways to control a

    * $1/each
    * [link to product](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/ECS-40.3-S-5PX-TR/XC1259TR-ND/827366)

    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Inexpensive                               | Requires external components and support circuitry for interface |
    | Compatible with PSoC                      | Needs special PCB layout.                                        |
    | Meets surface mount constraint of project |

1. CTX936TR-ND surface mount oscillator

    * $1/each
    * [Link to product](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/636L3I001M84320/CTX936TR-ND/2292940)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Outputs a square wave                                             | More expensive      |
    | Stable over operating temperature                                 | Slow shipping speed |
    | Direct interface with PSoC (no external circuitry required) range |

**Choice:** Option 2: CTX936TR-ND surface mount oscillator

**Rationale:** A clock oscillator is easier to work with because it requires no external circuitry in order to interface with the PSoC. This is particularly important because we are not sure of the electrical characteristics of the PCB, which could affect the oscillation of a crystal. While the shipping speed is slow, according to the website if we order this week it will arrive within 3 weeks.
