## Introduction

This datasheet will go over the first actuator of Team's 105 project.

### Project Summary

With this actuator, the motor will be acting as the main motor that will read input data from both the light and thermoresistors sensors. After receiving the input, the motor will output the action of rolling the blinds both up and down. Afterwards, this PCB will then give output to the second actuator.
